Odin Project landing page project

This is my submission for the Landing page project for The Odin Project. I work as an English teacher now, so I decided an English school themed landing page might closely resemble what is commonly found in my area.

This project really tested my flex abilities, as I had to repeatedly go back to previous lessons to figure out why certain elements weren't working as intended.
Nesting flexboxes seemed to be a particuarly difficult concept for me to integrate into this project. But after some (a lot) of review, I think I managed to get the page into a somewhat decent state.

My biggest gripe with this page at the moment is that it does not scale well with zoom. Zooming out seems to break the alignment of text and images on the "information" section.
It is likely a flex scaling issue or something along those lines, so I will have to iron that out later on.

Overall I am happy to have had the experience and troubles that came with this project. I can see myself coming back once I have honed my skills a bit more and update it.
